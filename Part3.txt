1. I used google gemini
2. Build a Python project called “Family Tree Demographic Simulator”. This project must simulate a multi-generational family tree using real demographic data from CSV files. You must follow all requirements exactly. Implement the project using these Python files: Person.py, PersonFactory.py, FamilyTree.py(Driver file). Then I just pasted the whole implementation part of the file.
3. My implementation is more since I manually initialized the founders and clearly manage the recursion flow. The LLM version is definitely more automated. It automatically generates founders and makes has gender probabilities build into the person factory logic. Mine is a lot cleaner but the LLM;s is probably more accurate due to having more factors and more randomness. 
4. I would consider having weighted gender probabilities and adjusting the number of children based on whether someone has a partner or not. This is what CS 562 has to do and I think it is just another level of accuracy, which the LLM is able to generate, to make this more realistic. 
5. I wouldn't take away my ability to specify founding parents or their names because it helps with control and testing.
