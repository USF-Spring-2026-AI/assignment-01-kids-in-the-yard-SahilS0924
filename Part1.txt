The Classification Scheme Awad uses organizes AI based on the role it plays in scientific research. Instead of basing AI on how they are built internally, the paper focuses on what the system actually does in the research process. For example he makes group like predictive AI which forecasts outcomes from data, descriptive AI which identifies patterns, generative AI which proposes new ideas or structures, optimization AI which improves efficiency in experiments, Interpretable AI which tries to explain why something happens rather than just predicting it. This classification matters because it really shows that how AI isn’t just 1 thing, but it can operate on various stages of scientific inquiry. By separating these roles, Awad makes it so we could easily see where AI can assist researchers, and where it could potentially influence how knowledge is produced.

Awad does make a clear distinction between AI as a tool and AI as a scientific collaborator. When AI is used as a tool, it is able to assist scientists by analyzing large datasets efficiently, identifying complex patterns faster than humans could, etc. However, in situations where AI acts as a collaborator, it starts contributing to the actual reasoning process generating hypotheses, suggesting different experimental designs, etc. The paper says that AI is on track to move towards passive assistance and active participation in discovery. However, what AI currently does is more of an extension of existing methods rather than a total reset. The real shift is more likely to be more gradual, especially in the field of scientific systems.

The paper also looks into some of the limitations of using AI in science. One major issue is interpretability, AI systems often make accurate predictions but are unable to clearly explain how they arrived at those results. My understanding of this ties to the black box because it leads to the gap scientists have with how solutions/conclusions are able to  be derived. Bias is also a big concern, since AI systems tend to learn from previous data, it may reflect on its ability to for unbiased thoughts. Reproducibility is also an issue with models that are dependent on specific/unique training data. There is also the risk that AI might identify correlations without having a real causal understanding, which would invalidate the theory. All of these risks show that even though AI is powerful and will definitely keep growing to a point where it can help the field more, as of now it can’t simply replace critical thinking and theoretical reasoning.

Awad says that AI is definitely accelerating scientific discovery, especially in more data-driven fields where pattern detection and prediction play a big role. An argument he had that I found interesting was that AI might actually reshape the current scientific method itself. If AI systems start to create hypotheses and guide experimental design, then the standard method where humans fully control the reasoning process, would quickly have to adapt to the change. As of now, I think that AI helps mostly due to the fact that it accelerates what scientists are capable of doing. However, the potential roadmap described in the paper might lead towards a deeper change. After reading the paper, I definitely agree with his views that AI will continue to advance and hold a bigger part in scientific research, but I don't think it can ever fully replace human reasoning.
